--Version 1.1
--THE LOG FILE WHICH KEEPS TOTAL LOG OF ALL DISTRACTIONS:
set log_file to POSIX file "/Users/fool/Dropbox/Backup/Docs/Me/Statistics/distractions_log.txt"
--A DUPLICATE LOG FILE WHICH WILL BE OPENED BY THE OTHER SCRIPT WHEN THE POMODORO IS DONE:
set todo_file to POSIX file "/Users/fool/Dropbox/Backup/Docs/Me/Statistics/distractions.txt"

--This script asks the user what the unplanned task was that made them interrupt their pomodoro
--Saves it both in a global log file, and in a simple todo file which will be opened (by another script) upon finishing
--or resetting the Pomodoro, so the user can then perform those tasks and delete them from the simple todo file

--To install this script, open the applescript tab of Pomodoro
--drag/drop the text of this script into the "Interrupt" box and check it
--Drag the text of the "open distraction list.scpt" script into the
--"Reset" and "End" boxes and check those
